I am excited to introduce you to the Food ShareHub project, which is a dynamic web application that facilitates seamless management of food donation and collection activities. This application has user-friendly interfaces that empower donors, admins, and agents to efficiently engage in the noble cause of food sharing. Some of the key features of this project include user authentication, donation tracking, and admin oversight, all powered by a tech stack of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
